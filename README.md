# Instructions to Build and Run this Image
'''
sudo docker build --tag=prophet .
'''
This will build a docker image that when launched will run in the background. 
So, in order to access it : 
'''
sudo docker run -it prophet /bin/bash
'''

You will end up at the command prompt inside the prophet docker container.
From here, you can run python and start with the prophet commands within.

'''
from fbprophet import Prophet
opts = {"daily_seasonality": False, "yearly_seasonality": True, "weekly_seasonality": True}
m = Prophet(**opts, changepoint_prior_scale=chgpt, growth='logistic', seasonality_mode=seasonality)
'''

There's no data set currently as an example. But this should be enough to get you started.
